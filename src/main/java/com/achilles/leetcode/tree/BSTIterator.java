/*	
 * 	Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
	Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.
	Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree. 
*/
//the idea is same as using stack to do Binary Tree Inorder Traversal 
/**
 * solution:
 * 		once you get to a TreeNode, in order to get the smallest, you need to go all the way down its left branch. 
 * 		So our first step is to point to pointer to the left most TreeNode. The problem is how to do back trace.
 * 		for next(), I directly return where the pointer pointing at, which should be the left most TreeNode I previously found. 
 * 		What to do next? After returning the smallest TreeNode, I need to point the pointer to the next smallest TreeNode. 
 * 		When the current TreeNode has a right branch (It cannot have left branch, remember we traversal to the left most), 
 * 		we need to jump to its right child first and then traversal to its right child's left most TreeNode.
 * 		When the current TreeNode doesn't have a right branch, it means there cannot be a node with value smaller than itself father node, 
 * 		point the pointer at its father node.
